## TEST CONCLUSION

**Issue 1.5 Navigation State Sync Issues**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

The navigation state sync is working perfectly:
- Parent menus expand correctly on page refresh
- Active items are highlighted properly  
- Works for both sidebar and home page navigation
- Route-based state management is functioning as expected

The remaining issues are related to missing/incomplete components, not navigation state sync.
